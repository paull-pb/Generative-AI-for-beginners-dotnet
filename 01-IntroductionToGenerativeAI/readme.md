## You Already Know How to Build AI Applications

Here's something that might surprise you: if you've ever called a REST API, you already have the core skill needed to build AI-powered applications.

Think about it. When you call an API, you send a request and get a response. Building with AI is the same pattern:

```csharp
var response = await chatClient.GetResponseAsync("Summarize this customer feedback");

Console.WriteLine(response);
```

That's the entire concept. You send a prompt. You get a response. Your existing .NET skills handle everything else: dependency injection, configuration, error handling, async patterns.

No PhD required. No Python. No complex ML pipelines.

This course will prove it to you, not with slides and theory, but with real, runnable code that you'll build yourself.

## What You Will Learn in This Lesson

By the end of this lesson, you will:

1. **Understand what Generative AI actually is**, stripped of the hype and mystery
2. **Know why your .NET skills already prepare you** for AI development
3. **See the key difference** between traditional programming and AI-powered applications
4. **Get your development environment ready** so you can start coding immediately

No prerequisites beyond basic .NET knowledge. We'll build everything step by step.

## What Is Generative AI, Really?

**Generative AI is software that creates new content** (text, images, code, audio) based on patterns it learned from existing data.

That's the entire concept. When you use ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or DALL-E, you're using generative AI.

### How Does It Actually Work?

At the heart of most generative AI applications, usually, are **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. These are neural networks trained on massive amounts of text data. During training, they learn patterns, relationships, and structures in language.

When you send a prompt to an LLM, it doesn't "understand" in the human sense. Instead, it predicts the most likely next tokens (words or word pieces) based on patterns it learned. The result feels intelligent because those patterns came from billions of examples of human writing.

Key concepts:

- **Tokens**: LLMs break text into small pieces called tokens. A token might be a word, part of a word, or punctuation. When you see "token limits," this refers to how much text the model can process at once.

    ![How text is broken into tokens](./images/tokens-visualization.png)

    _Source: [Microsoft Learn - Prompt Engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering)_

- **Context Window**: The amount of text an LLM can "see" at one time. Larger context windows let you include more information in your prompts.
- **Temperature**: A setting that controls randomness. Lower temperature (0.0-0.3) gives more predictable, focused responses. Higher temperature (0.7-1.0) gives more creative, varied responses.

> **Learn more:** [Key concepts and considerations in generative AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/ai/gen-ai-concepts-considerations-developers) covers token limits, pricing, context windows, and other essential AI concepts.

### Ok, how It's Different from Traditional Programming?

Let's think about how you write code today versus how you interact with an AI model:

| Traditional Programming | Generative AI |
|------------------------|---------------|
| You write explicit rules | You describe what you want |
| Output is **deterministic** (same input = same output) | Output is **probabilistic** (same input ≈ similar outputs) |
| `if (score > 90) return "A";` | `"Grade this essay and explain why"` |
| You handle every edge case | The model generalizes from patterns |

**Example:**

- **Old way:** Write 500 lines of code to analyze sentiment in customer reviews using regex and keyword matching.
- **New way:** Send the review to an AI model with the prompt "Is this customer happy, neutral, or unhappy? Explain why."

It learned patterns from millions of examples and applies them to your specific input.

### What About Training Models?

Here's what you **don't** need to worry about:

- Training models (that's for research labs with massive compute budgets)
- Understanding neural network math (helpful but not required)
- Learning Python (.NET works great)

Here's what you **do** need to know:

- How to call AI models (just like calling any API)
- How to write good prompts (we'll cover this)
- How to integrate AI into your applications (your existing .NET skills)

### The Importance of Prompts

Since you're describing what you want rather than coding explicit rules, the way you write prompts matters enormously. A well-crafted prompt can be the difference between a useful response and a useless one.

Good prompts typically:

- **Provide context**: Tell the model what role it should play or what domain it's working in
- **Be specific**: Vague prompts get vague answers
- **Include examples**: Show the model what good output looks like
- **Set constraints**: Specify format, length, or style requirements

We'll practice prompt engineering throughout this course, starting in Lesson 02.

## Why .NET Developers Are Ready Right Now

There's a misconception that AI development requires Python or specialized ML expertise.

**This is false.**

You already have the core skills:

| Skill You Already Have | How It Applies to AI |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Calling REST APIs | AI models are accessed via APIs |
| Dependency Injection | Swap AI providers without changing code |
| Async/await patterns | AI calls are async operations |
| Configuration management | API keys, endpoints, model selection |
| Error handling | AI calls can fail, need retry logic |

### The Magic of `IChatClient`

Microsoft created a unified abstraction called `IChatClient` (part of Microsoft.Extensions.AI). It works just like the patterns you already know:

- Think `ILogger`, but for AI conversations
- Think `HttpClient`, but for model interactions

**One interface, any AI provider:**

```csharp
// Use OpenAI
IChatClient client = new OpenAIChatClient("gpt-5-mini", apiKey);

// Or use a local model with Ollama
IChatClient client = new OllamaChatClient(new Uri("http://localhost:11434"), "phi4-mini");

// Or use Azure OpenAI
IChatClient client = new AzureOpenAIChatClient(endpoint, credential, "gpt-5-mini");

// Your application code stays exactly the same!
var response = await client.GetResponseAsync("Hello, AI!");
```

Switch providers by changing one line. Your business logic never changes.

## The Tools You'll Use

Now that you understand the concepts, let's look at the tools. We'll go from simple to advanced.

### Layer 1: Microsoft.Extensions.AI (MEAI)

This is your foundation. MEAI provides:

- `IChatClient` for text conversations
- `IEmbeddingGenerator` for vector search scenarios
- Built-in support for caching, telemetry, and retries

**Think of it as:** The plumbing that connects your code to any AI model.

### Layer 2: AI Models (The "Brains")

You have options:

| Option | Best For | Cost |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Ollama (Local)** | Privacy, offline work, learning | Free |
| **Azure OpenAI / Microsoft Foundry** | Production, enterprise, compliance | Pay-per-use |

All of these work with the same `IChatClient` interface!

### Layer 3: Microsoft Agent Framework

**Microsoft Agent Framework** — Build intelligent agents with .NET using the open-source Microsoft Agent Framework. Agents are AI workers that can use tools, maintain state, and collaborate with other agents. See [Lesson 04: Agents with MAF](../04-AgentsWithMAF/readme.md) for hands-on samples.

But first, let's get you coding with the basics.
